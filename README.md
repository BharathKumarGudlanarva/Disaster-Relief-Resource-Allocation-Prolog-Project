# Disaster-Relief-Resource-Allocation-Prolog-Project
The idea came from imagining how an AI system could logically decide what resources matter most during a crisis. For example, in floods, water and shelter take priority, while in a pandemic, medical aid comes first.

This project is an Expert System built in Prolog that helps allocate essential resources during disasters such as floods, earthquakes, cyclones, and pandemics. The system prioritizes resources like food, water, shelter, medical aid, and volunteers based on logical rules, ensuring that critical needs are addressed first.
